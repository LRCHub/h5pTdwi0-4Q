Usually takes me a little bit to find it anyways
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Yes, yes
Fuck you, Jake
Dude, fuck this intro

I know nun 'bout sports, but I got my balls out
So many assets, I've capital size of Moscow
Self-made and self-employed, I never clock out
And me and Kudge are forever Virgins, we ain't gonna stop now
(Never had sex)
Stripes on my feet like you know I got the tigers on
Stripes on her face like that chick shoulda had the vipers on
Been so many months, God damn can't even write a song
But I know that it's gonna go gold, I got my Midas on
Hold up, I need a moment of silence

Kudge comin in hot, like I'm fucking in saunas
We're the world worst boyband, I must be honest
I got nothing to hide, I'm opposite Drake and Adonnis
Fans said we falling off, I guess we're faking the comments
This new bitch, she half Greek, like I'm dating with Giannis
Your new favorite group done set the bar too low
My girl's got a culo, my boys getting checks
Man I'm at the crib watching Zack and Cody with my ex-bitch
Later I'ma get a tee time with my next bitch
See if she can handle a stick and balls
Then I'll stick my balls
Perfectly inside her like it's Tetris
Get this, I just pulled up in a sick Jag
Say you don't like us, it's like you never heard Big Bag
Same set, but the metal looking mismatched
All real here man, go and check the gift tag

Cum and then I go like I'm the gas station
White car, yellow interior like I'm wasian
Hella crowds staring at me, like I run a nation
Multicolored bitches, I got some Dalmatians
Bitch with a caboose, I think she pissed off
And I gotta make an excuse, because my dick's soft
Tryna get this weight off my chest like I was Rick Ross
Then I'm finna walk to this bitch, my name is Christoph

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
I-I know nun 'bout sports, but I got my balls out
I-I know nun 'bout sports, but I got my balls out
I know nun 'bout sports, but I got my balls out
And me and Kudge are forever Virgins, we ain't gonna stop now
